View the 3PL API Documentation here: https://app02.3plcentral.com/webserviceexternal/contracts.asmx
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem '3pl_central'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install 3pl_central

## Usage

### Per Usage Configuration
This method works indentically to the other, it just makes it easier to deal with different customer records, usernames, IDs, etc. that you might have in 3PL Central.
```ruby
client = ThreePLCentral::Client.new(three_pl_key: "{a123457-a389-4674-bcdd-a646150aaf}", login: "3pluser"  , password: "3plpass", three_pl_id: "123")

client.create_order(params_for_order_create)

client.find_order(params_for_find_order)

client.find_small_parcel_order(params_for_shipment)

client.get_stock_status(params_for_stock_status)


```


### Per Application Configuration

```ruby
  require '3pl_central'

  ThreePLCentral.configure do |c|
    c.three_pl_key        = "{YOUR GUID GOES HERE}"
    c.login               = "customer_login" #configured in 3PL Central -> Customer -> Customer Users
    c.password            = "customer_password" # same as login
    c.default_facility_id = 1 #this might be removed in a later version, and we'll just look for the "Facility ID" on the order or item level.
    # c.user_login_id       = 4 #We had to contact our account manager with 3PL Central to get this information.
    c.customer_id         = 1

    # three_pl_id is for reading, three_pl_key is for writing
    c.three_pl_id         = "three_pl_id"

    # Pass configuration values to Savon
    # See values in Savon documentation
    c.savon_config        = {
      log: false
    }
  end

```

## TODOs
1. Move the credentials to a "per request" basis, rather than being configured for the entire instance of the gem, in our integration we'll use this to separate out to different (3PL Central) customers that we're interacting with.
1. Write tests, there aren't any done currently. However there's not a whole lot of logic either.
1. Expose configuration of Savon gem. Currently the defaults we set aren't changeable, and Savon is going to be spitting out a fair amount of debugging information.
1. Fix `Guardfile`, it only seems to generate documentation currently, not run the specs.
1. Wrap other functionality, an observant user might notice that only part of the 3PL Central web service is wrapped, that's because we just did what we needed for our specific implementation.
1. Document more examples, we should have a working example for each of the services that are wrapped.
